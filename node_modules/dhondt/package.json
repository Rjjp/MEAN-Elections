  "readme": "# D'Hondt\r\nD'Hondt is a utility that computes election results and outputs number of mandates each party received. See [D'Hondt method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Hondt_method) wiki page for details on how the D'Hondt algorithm works.\r\n##API\r\n    dhondt.compute(votes, mandates [, options])\r\n\r\n* **votes** is an array of how many votes each party has received or an array of object if you specify options.voteAccessor function (see examples)\r\n* **mandates** is an integer, how many mandates are being allocated\r\n* **options** object can have following properties:\r\n    * **voteAccessor:** function returning the number of votes from an object\r\n    * **resultProperty:** if array of objects is passed, specifies which property of the object should house the result. If not specified, array of mandates is returned\r\n    * **base:** Specifies the base divider used in first round of mandate allocation. Sometimes 1.42 is used to favor large parties is smaller districts.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n    var dhondt = require ('dhondt')\r\n    var votes = [100000, 80000, 30000, 20000];\r\n    var mandates = 8;\r\n    var results = dhondt.compute(votes, mandates);\r\n    console.log(results);\r\n    // [ 4, 3, 1, 0 ]\r\n\r\n    var parties = [\r\n        {party: \"A\", votes: 100},\r\n        {party: \"B\", votes:  60},\r\n        {party: \"C\", votes:  45}\r\n    ];\r\n    var mandates = 2;\r\n    options = {\r\n        voteAccessor: function(object) {return object.votes},\r\n        resultProperty: \"mandates\",\r\n        base: 1.42\r\n    }\r\n    var results = dhondt.compute(parties, mandates, options);\r\n    console.log(results);\r\n    // [ { party: 'A', votes: 100, mandates: 2 },\r\n    //   { party: 'B', votes: 60, mandates: 0 },\r\n    //   { party: 'C', votes: 45, mandates: 0 } ]\r\n\r\n## Licence (MIT)\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Economia, a.s.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\r\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\r\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\r\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\r\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\r\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
